#### gossamer

Gossamer is a thin shell for HTML5 games, using [browserify](https://github.com/substack/browserify), [chipmunk-js](https://github.com/josephg/chipmunk-js) and a few little classes to get you started (`GameObject`, `World`, `TitleScreen`).

This is intended to be a copy/paste-and-edit framework a la [atom](https://github.com/nornagon/atom). Fork at will!
